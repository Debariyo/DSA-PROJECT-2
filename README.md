### 🔍 **Project Overview**

In response to public criticism regarding gender inequality, Palmoria Group's HR leadership tasked me with analyzing employee data to uncover disparities in gender distribution, pay structure, and performance evaluation across its three operational regions.

Using Power BI, I built a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard that provided insights into gender-related concerns and supported executive decision-making for inclusive policy development and minimum wage compliance.

### 🧩 **Key Objectives**

* Assess **gender distribution** across regions and departments
* Analyze **performance ratings** by gender
* Identify **gender pay gaps** and non-compliance with the \$90,000 minimum salary regulation
* Calculate and visualize **bonus payouts** based on performance ratings
* Determine **total compensation** (salary + bonus) per employee and region
* Present **salary distribution by \$10,000 bands**, regionally and company-wide

### 📊 **Analysis Highlights**

* **Gender Gaps Identified:** Visualizations revealed male dominance in technical departments and leadership roles across all regions.
* **Performance Bias:** Males had slightly higher performance ratings on average in Region C.
* **Pay Disparities:** Significant gender pay gaps in departments like Engineering and Operations, especially in Region B.
* **Minimum Salary Compliance:** About 14% of employees were below the \$90,000 minimum threshold—most concentrated in Region A.
* **Bonus Calculation:** Bonus payments were calculated using DAX formulas based on employee ratings (Excellent, Good, Average).
* **Salary Band Visualization:** Salaries grouped into \$10,000 bands to better understand compensation spread and inequality patterns.
