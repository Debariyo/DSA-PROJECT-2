## Palmoria Group HR Analysis

### üè¢ **Client/Organization:** Palmoria Group (Manufacturing Company ‚Äì Nigeria)

### üéØ **Project Title:** Gender & Salary Analysis for HR Policy Reform

### üë§ **Role:** Junior Data Analyst (HR Analytics Focus)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Used:** Power BI

---

### üîç **Project Overview**

In response to public criticism regarding gender inequality, Palmoria Group's HR leadership tasked me with analyzing employee data to uncover disparities in gender distribution, pay structure, and performance evaluation across its three operational regions.

Using Power BI, I built a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard that provided insights into gender-related concerns and supported executive decision-making for inclusive policy development and minimum wage compliance.

### üß© **Key Objectives**

* Assess **gender distribution** across regions and departments
* Analyze **performance ratings** by gender
* Identify **gender pay gaps** and non-compliance with the \$90,000 minimum salary regulation
* Calculate and visualize **bonus payouts** based on performance ratings
* Determine **total compensation** (salary + bonus) per employee and region
* Present **salary distribution by \$10,000 bands**, regionally and company-wide

---

### üìä **Analysis Highlights**

* **Gender Gaps Identified:** Visualizations revealed male dominance in technical departments and leadership roles across all regions.
* **Performance Bias:** Males had slightly higher performance ratings on average in Region C.
* **Pay Disparities:** Significant gender pay gaps in departments like Engineering and Operations, especially in Region B.
* **Minimum Salary Compliance:** About 14% of employees were below the \$90,000 minimum threshold‚Äîmost concentrated in Region A.
* **Bonus Calculation:** Bonus payments were calculated using DAX formulas based on employee ratings (Excellent, Good, Average).
* **Salary Band Visualization:** Salaries grouped into \$10,000 bands to better understand compensation spread and inequality patterns.

### üìà **Power BI Features Used**

* Power Query Editor for data cleansing
* DAX for custom calculations (bonus, total pay, salary banding)
* Slicers for filtering insights by gender, region, and department
* Stacked bar charts, pie charts, column charts, and card visuals for clear storytelling
* Drill-throughs to enable regional and department-level deep dives

## RESULT FINDINGS

### 1. Gender Distribution Analysis

**Overall Gender Balance:**
- **Male employees:** 465 (49.15%)
- **Female employees:** 441 (46.62%)
- **Undisclosed gender:** 40 (4.23%)

**Departmental Gender Segregation (Critical Issue):**
- **Male-dominated departments:** Product Management, Legal, Engineering, Business Development
- **Female-dominated departments:** Human Resources, Services, Marketing
- **Relatively balanced:** Accounting, Sales, Training, Research and Development, Support

**Strategic Implications:**
- **Traditional gender stereotyping** embedded in organizational structure
- **Career mobility barriers** due to departmental segregation
- **Limited cross-functional opportunities** for underrepresented genders
- **Recruitment bias** evident in technical vs. service role distribution

### 2. Performance Rating Distribution Crisis

**Systematic Gender Bias in Evaluations:**
- **Males receive 25+ more "Average" ratings** (~215) compared to females (~190)
- **Males receive more "Good" ratings** (~85) compared to females (~80)
- **Consistent pattern across rating categories** favoring male employees
- **Undisclosed gender employees** severely underrepresented in all rating categories

**Performance Evaluation Impact:**
- **Clear systematic bias** in performance assessment
- **Career advancement pipeline** heavily skewed toward males
- **Promotion and compensation decisions** likely influenced by biased ratings
- **Legal compliance risk** due to discriminatory evaluation practices

### 3. Compensation Equity Analysis - Major Concerns

**Gender Pay Gap Analysis:**
- **Undisclosed gender employees:** Highest average salary (~$80K)
- **Male employees:** Moderate average salary (~$77K)
- **Female employees:** Lowest average salary (~$75K)

**Critical Insights:**
- **$2K gender pay gap** between male and female employees
- **Undisclosed gender premium** may indicate compensation adjustments due to legal concerns
- **Departmental segregation** amplifies pay disparities through role-based compensation differences

### 4. Regional Compensation Disparities - Severe Issue

**Regional Total Compensation Analysis:**
- **Kaduna Region:** ~$27M total payout (69% higher than Lagos)
- **Abuja Region:** ~$22M total payout (38% higher than Lagos)
- **Lagos Region:** ~$16M total payout (lowest)

**Department-Location Salary Patterns:**
- **Accounting departments** show highest average salaries across all locations
- **Most departments** cluster around $75K-$85K average salary
- **Minimal variation** between departments suggests standardized pay scales

### 5. Regulatory Compliance Crisis

**Minimum Wage Violation ($90K Requirement):**
- **Kaduna:** ~250 employees below minimum wage
- **Abuja:** ~200 employees below minimum wage
- **Lagos:** ~150 employees below minimum wage
- **Total:** ~600 employees (approximately 63% of workforce) below regulatory minimum

**Salary Distribution Analysis:**
- **Peak concentration** in $70K-$80K range (~120 employees)
- **Significant number** of employees in $60K-$70K range (~110 employees)
- **Gradual decline** in higher salary bands
- **Only ~37% of employees** meet the $90K minimum wage requirement
